Cheeta is just lib to get started when creating database tables using Python.
It is still basic , not much in it for now. But one can still try a few examples.
To try it out, open python file names scheme.py and copy and paste the below.
After open main.py, and update your database details. When you are done, just 
run main.

	  

class UserTable(model.thebase):
	name = model.CharClass()
	age = model.IntClass()
	place_of_birth = model.CharClass()
	
class AddressTable(model.thebase):
	user_name = UserTable("name")
	street_name = model.CharClass()
	city_name = model.CharClass()
	street_number = model.IntClass()
	state_name = model.CharClass()
	country_name = model.CharClass()

If you notice bugs, please mail them to me. In case you have ideas on how to make
this app better, just let me know too.
